First of all, I would like to pay my humble gratitude to our visionary Monarchs for being the pillar of strength and source of inspiration to keep us moving through these challenging times. Despite the hurdles brought in by the pandemic, His Majesty travelled across the country to reassure that each one of us are loved and cared for. Thank you Your Majesty for being our parent, our guide and a protector. <br><br>
Second, as we delightfully re-open school sin 18 Dzongkhags following the directive of -the government, l would like to take this opportunity to thank the government led by Hon'ble Prime Minister who left no stones unturned to keep us safe. It is also with due respect that the everlasting prayers of the Zhung Dratsang led by His Holiness the Je Khenpothat helped us steer forward together to Combat the pandemic. <br><br>

My dear students, the last academic year has been very challenging. l am proud of each one of you for enduring the hardships and making thus far. For students in grade IX to XII, I am very delighted to welcome you back to the school with easing of lockdown.<br><br>
I believe you have prepared yourselves well for the journey ahead. It is ever more important that we remind ourselves of the importance bestowed upon the youth and education by our far-sighted visionary Monarchs and strive for excellence. I would also like to congratulate students of classes PP to VIII for coping with online learning and successfully completing your academic year. Irrespective of whether you are in the school or at home, I would like to urge you all to follow precautionary measures in light of the risk of the pandemic. <br><br>
My dear teachers, in a year that was ever more important, your determination and willpower have paid off in ways we can't measure. I want to thank you for making this happen. You have been through very difficult times yet you did not leave anything unaccomplished. For yet another year, with new challenges and opportunities wish you luck to move forward with the same zeal and enthusiasm.<br><br>
My dear parents, your continuous support and guidance made it possible for the students to cope with the new challenges. Had it not been for your crucial role, it would have been difficult for our teachers to proceed on with the teaching learning sessions. Thank you for making home a better place to learn, despite your busy schedule. Thank you for sacrificing for the betterment of our children. <br><br>
